# Tik-Tac-Toe-impossible
An unbeatable Tic Tac Toe game built using Python and Tkinter with Minimax AI algorithm.
# Unbeatable Tic Tac Toe 🎮

An **unbeatable Tic Tac Toe game** built using **Python** and **Tkinter**, featuring an AI opponent powered by the **Minimax algorithm**.

The AI always plays the optimal move, making it impossible to defeat.

---

## 🔥 Features
- Single-player mode (Human vs AI)
- Unbeatable AI using Minimax algorithm
- Simple and clean GUI
- Lightweight and fast
- No external libraries required

---

## 🧠 How the AI Works
The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm**, a recursive decision-making algorithm that:
- Evaluates all possible future game states
- Chooses the best possible move
- Guarantees a win or a draw for the AI

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Tkinter** (GUI)
- **Minimax Algorithm**
- **Math module**
